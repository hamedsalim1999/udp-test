## first step you should be run server.py by 
```bash
python3 server.py
```
or
```bash
python server.py
```
If the server application asks you for your IP address and port number, you must enter the server's IP address and any port you desire


## next step run clinet.py by 
```bash
python3 clinet.py
```
or
```bash
python clinet.py
```
Client application asks you for your IP address and port number and asks you about the delay, and delays are measured in seconds like ```5.6``` or ```0.2``` (i.e. 5.6 seconds or 0.2 seconds) you should set the server IP address and server applications port.

Log files are created by both the server and client applications. Send and receive times are recorded in the log files. 

You can edit data.txt, a client application reads data from this file and sends it to a server application
